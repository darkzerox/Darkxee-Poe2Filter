# DZX Filter Build System Requirements
# Python dependencies for building Path of Exile 2 filters

# Core Python (3.6+ required)
# All scripts use only standard library modules:
# - os, sys, pathlib
# - typing (for type hints)  
# - argparse (for command line interfaces)
# - subprocess (for git operations)
# - logging (for improved logging)
# - dataclasses (for structured data, Python 3.7+)
# - re (for regex parsing)

# No external dependencies required!
# The build system is designed to work with Python standard library only.

# Optional development tools (not required for building):
# black>=22.0.0          # Code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0          # Linting  
# mypy>=0.950            # Type checking
# pytest>=7.0.0          # Testing framework

# For Python < 3.7, you may need:
# dataclasses>=0.6       # Backport of dataclasses

# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or for development:
# pip install -r requirements.txt black flake8 mypy pytest
